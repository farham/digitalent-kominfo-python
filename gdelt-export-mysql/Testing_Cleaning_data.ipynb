       "      <th>BENGALURU: Indonesia’s bike taxi service Go-Jek , one of the most watched startups in Southeast Asia, is setting up a development centre in India by acquiring two local companies — Bengaluru-based software engineering company C42 Engineering and Delhi-based CodeIgnition.The deal is aimed at helping Go-Jek set up a research &amp; development (R&amp;D) center in Bengaluru, where it plans to recruit over 100 senior engineers in the next six months. Size or structure of the transactions was not disclosed.Go-Jek, which is backed by Sequoia Capital India and Yuri Milner’s DST Global, zeroed in on the Indian companies while searching for a solution to a software bug that hit its mobile application.“We lost control over our growth then our investor Sequoia extended a helping hand by introducing us to founders of C42 and CodeIgnition, they saved us from imploding,” said Nadiem Makarim, the Jakarta-based founder of Go-Jek. The company’s mobile application downloads have grown to 11million since it was launched in January 2015.Makarim said that Go-Jek has become the largest consumer-internet company in Indonesia on parameters like number of transactions, funding raised and valuation.He declined to disclose any numbers, and the company had not even formally announced its financing rounds from Sequoia and DST Global, so far.Having begun as a bike taxi business, Go-Jek has diversified into food delivery, one-hour courier delivery, grocery delivery and even has aggregated trucks on its platform.It has partnered with 2,00,000 motorcycle drivers and 5,000 trucks across Indonesia, claiming that daily transaction volumes have gone up over a hundredfold in the last six months.“We have more vehicles than Uber has in the US, and we are the largest online food delivery company outside the US and China,” said Makarim, a Harvard Business School MBA who has worked at consulting firm McKinsey and Germany’s internet accelerator Rocket Internet.“We are all online and offline businesses rolled up into one, which is unlike India and China where things are fairly specialised,” said Makarim, adding that Go-Jek is a mix of Ola, Zomato, Tinyowl, Grofers and few other startups rolled into one given the cross selling opportunities.Experts tracking the cross border M&amp;A space said that this is a first of its kind acquisition from a South East Asian internet company. “We have seen interest from the US companies to set up development centres here through acquisitions here, not Asian companies,” said Sanat Rao, M&amp;A adviser at software product think tank iSPIRT.C42 Engineering, which has worked with Indian e-tailers like Flipkart ad Urbanladder, was founded in 2010 as a boutique ruby and rails consultancy. Its founders include former software consulting firm Thoughtworks execs Sidu Ponnappa and Niranjan Paranjape, and restaurant review platform Burrp’s alumni Aakash Dharmadhikari.</th>\n",

Hampir 500.000 lebih sudah mengikuti program GO-JEK SWADAYA.\\n\\nVice President of Drivers Community GO-JEK Indonesia Jaka Wiradisuria mengatakan, untuk wilayah Bali, pihaknya bekerja sama dengan industri perbankan seperti BTN untuk cicilan KPR, BNI Syariah untuk tabungan umrah, dan program proteksi dari Pasar Polis. Sebelum ada program GO-JEK SWADAYA, mitra driver kerap kesulitan mengajukan bantuan pembiayaan tersebut.\\n\\nDia mencontohkan saat ini mitra driver yang ingin memiliki rumah idaman dapat memanfaatkan skema cicilan Kredit Perumahan Rakyat (KPR) harian. Hanya dengan Rp48.000 per hari, para mitra driver dapat memiliki rumah idaman mereka. Para mitra driver dapat dengan mudah memanfaatkan program GO-JEK SWADAYA yang ada pada aplikasi driver mereka untuk mengajukan kredit pemilikan rumah (KPR).\\n\\n\"Ini membuktikan bahwa para mitra driver Bali dapat menikmati semua akses finansial yang sebelumnya sulit bagi mereka,\" katanya, Jumat (31/8/2018).\\n\\nMenurut Jaka, mitra driver juga mendapatkan akses proteksi finansial terjangkau, mulai dari asuransi kesehatan on-trip dan off-trip bagi mitra dan keluarga melalui kerja sama dengan Allianz. Selain itu, ada jaminan barang pribadi dan perlindungan kecelakaan melalui kerja sama dengan Pasar Polis, serta jaminan hari tua melalui kerja sama dengan BPJS Ketenagakerjaan.\\n\\n\"Hadirnya kami di 66 kota di Indonesia juga membuka jalan seluas-luasnya pada peningkatan inklusi finansial di kalangan mitra pengemudi,” katanya.</th>\n",

On average, fines were Rp 2 million per driver. They said it was about fictitious orders,” Firdaus Abdilah Saputra, a Bali Go-Jek driver told Tribun Bali.\\n\\nAccording to Saputra, the drivers were accused of cheating by PT Go-Jek. He said drivers suddenly received text messages with no warnings or explanations about fines they were given.\\n\\nApparently not so many drivers were thrilled with this turn of events so they took to the streets to protest to Go-Jek and demand further explanations for their fines and suspensions.\\n\\nGo-Jek has not yet made a public statement to the press about the demo.</th>\n",

       "      <th>Liputan6.com, Jakarta - Keberadaan Go-Jek alias ojek online dianggap musuh bersama oleh para tukang ojek yang biasa mangkal di suatu tempat. Bisnis ini dinilai menjatuhkan harga pasaran ojek lainnya.\\n\\n\\n\\nSebut saja Yosi (46), tukang ojek di kawasan Senayan, Jakarta yang mengeluhkan kehadiran Go-Jek di Ibukota. Saat mendengar kata Gojek saja, dari mulut Pria asal Bogor, Jawa Barat ini langsung keluar kata musuh.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Go-Jek itu musuh, kenapa? Karena mereka menjatuhkan harga pasaran,\" ketus dia saat berbincang dengan Liputan6.com di pangkalan ojek Senayan, Minggu (14/6/2015).\\n\\n\\n\\nDijelaskannya, Go-Jek menggunakan sistem tarif per kilometer (km). Setiap satu km dipungut tarif Rp 4.000. Jadi dengan rute Senayan-Depok, Go-Jek hanya mengenakan tarif Rp 76 ribu per orang.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Kemarin teman saya yang bergabung di Go-Jek narik Senayan-Depok dapat uang Rp 76 ribu. Lalu dipotong kantornya 20 persen, sisanya buat teman saya,\" terang Yosi.\\n\\n\\n\\nSementara Yosi mengenakan tarif standar, seperti Senayan-Kemang Rp 30 ribu, Senayan-Blok M Rp 20 ribu. Itupun diakuinya penumpang masih saja menawar harga. Yosi memasang tarif tinggi atau mencapai dua kali lipat, apabila terjebak pada situasi dan kondisi macet serta banjir.\\n\\n\\n\\nApalagi, tegas dia, perusahaan yang menaungi para ojek online ini tengah memberlakukan tarif promo Rp 10 ribu kemanapun tujuannya. Artinya mau jurusan darimana dan kemana saja, Go-Jek hanya mengenakan tarif Rp 10 ribu per orang.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mau ke Bekasi, Depok atau lainnya cuma dipungut Rp 10 ribu selama Ramadan. Ini kan menjatuhkan harga sekali, masa kita harus nyamain mereka. Tekor dong,\" ucapnya.\\n\\n\\n\\nFenomena kehadiran Go-Jek, diakui dia, semakin membuat keberadaan ojek-ojek pangkalan tergusur. Pendapatan merosot, dan terkadang penumpang ojek pangkalan diserobot Go-Jek.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Langganan banyak yang kabur pakai Go-Jek, dari 7 orang langganan, sekarang saya cuma pegang 3 orang. Penghasilan pun turun dari biasanya Rp 100 ribu per hari, jadi cuma Rp 50 ribu-Rp 80 ribu,\" tutur Yosi. (Fik/Ndw)</th>\n",

Size or structure of the transactions was not disclosed.Go-Jek, which is backed by Sequoia Capital India and Yuri Milner’s DST Global, zeroed in on the Indian companies while searching for a solution to a software bug that hit its mobile application.“We lost control over our growth then our investor Sequoia extended a helping hand by introducing us to founders of C42 and CodeIgnition, they saved us from imploding,” said Nadiem Makarim, the Jakarta-based founder of Go-Jek. The company’s mobile application downloads have grown to 11million since it was launched in January 2015.Makarim said that Go-Jek has become the largest consumer-internet company in Indonesia on parameters like number of transactions, funding raised and valuation.He declined to disclose any numbers, and the company had not even formally announced its financing rounds from Sequoia and DST Global, so far. Having begun as a biketaxi business, Go-Jek has diversified into food delivery, one-hour courier delivery, grocery delivery and even has aggregated trucks on its platform. It has partnered with 2,00,000 motorcycle drivers and 5,000 trucks across Indonesia, claiming that daily transaction volumes have gone up over a hundredfold in the last six months.“We have more vehicles than Uber has in the US, and we are the largest online food delivery company outside the US and China,” said Makarim, a Harvard Business School MBA who has worked at consulting firm McKinsey and Germany’s internet accelerator Rocket Internet.“We are all online and offline businesses rolled up into one, which is unlike India and China where things are fairly specialised,” said Makarim, adding that Go-Jek is a mix of Ola, Zomato, Tinyowl, Grofers and few other startups rolled into one given the cross selling opportunities.Experts tracking the cross border M&amp;A space said that this is a first of its kind acquisition from a South East Asian internet company. “We have seen interest from the US companies to set up development centres here through acquisitions here, not Asian companies,” said Sanat Rao, M&amp;A adviser at software product think tank iSPIRT.C42 Engineering, which has worked with Indian etailers like Flipkart ad Urbanladder, was founded in 2010 as a boutique ruby and rails consultancy. Its founders include former software consulting firm Thoughtworks execs Sidu Ponnappa and Niranjan Paranjape, and restaurant review platform Burrp’s alumni Aakash Dharmadhikari.</th>\n",

The reason is that ojeg (or motor taxi) services are not regulated within the law. However, it is proven that their services are beneficial for the public.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There is no plan of legalization, just stay in the dark,\" Ahok said at the City Hall, Medan Merdeka Selatan, Central Jakarta, Tuesday (7/7/2015).\\n\\n\\n\\nRecently, the presence of Go-Jek and GrabBike received rejection from local ojeg and other public transportation operators such as Organda DKI. Ahok said Organda's rejection against Go-Jek is due to the competition of land transportation businesses.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe advised Organda's to follow the Rp/kilometer system to be applied by the city administration. Ahok also urged the local base ojeg to join Go-Jek. \"If Organda wants to be good, they have to follow Rp/kilometer. To gain profit,\" he stated.\\n\\n\\n\\nAhok realized the presence of ojeg or Go-Jek haven't been regulated within the law. But Organda's is asked not to be a hypocrite, as the two-wheeled public transportation is extremely needed to break through the capital's traffic jam, whether it is recognized or not.\\n\\n\\n\\nPreviously, Organda had refused the presence of ojeg following the establishment of Go-Jek. The reason was because the two were not listed as a public transportation mode in the Traffic (LLAJ) Law No. 22 Year 2009. In the regulation, it is mentioned that motorcycle is not a public transport for people and goods. (Eps)\\n\\n(WIL)</th>\n",

Photo: Reddit/Roflpaladin\\n\\nSince its smartphone application debuted early this year, motorcycle taxi service Go-Jek has quickly become an integral part of Jakarta’s transportation network. This has led to numerous clashes with traditional ojek drivers that have been covered extensively in the media (there’s a particularly illuminating article on the subject from Tech in Asia).\\n\\nThe government and police have promised to protect Go-Jek drivers from other ojek drivers who attack or intimidate them for working in their territory, but there had been little evidence of that protection reported in the media so far.\\n\\nBut now some Go-Jek drivers are claiming that the police are backing them up in a big way – by sending undercover officers to crack down on places where traditional ojeks have organized against the new guard.\\n\\n“Now we are receiving back up from members of Brimob (Mobile Brigade Police). So at vulnerable points, there are members of Brimob disguised in civilian clothes,” Faridz Budhi a 33 year old Go-Jek driver, told Kompas on Sunday.\\n\\nFaridz said he felt a lot safer now when entering areas that were previously prone to intimidation against Go-Jeks, though he said he had never experienced any harassment directly since he started the Go-Jek gig a month ago.\\n\\nAnother Go-Jek driver, Helmi Can, echoed Faridz sentiments, saying, “We have been told about this. We have backup from Brimob, so there is no need to worry.”\\n\\nWhile it would certainly be good if the police were making such an effort to protect Go-Jek drivers from intimidation and abuse, the police themselves have not confirmed an operation like the Go-Jek drivers described.\\n\\nWhen asked by Kompas, Jakarta Police Chief Tito Karnavian claimed not to know anything about it.\\n\\n“I have not heard of (Brimob members providing backup for Go-Jeks),” Tito said yesterday.\\n\\nBut the police chief said that his officers would of course take action against any criminal actions by ojeks, regardless of the victims.\\n\\nSo are the Go-Jek drivers misinformed? Or are the police actually just not telling the media about an ongoing undercover operation? We’ll just have to wait and see how much worse the battle of old and new will get.</th>\n",

But it looks like we won’t find out for a while, as both Go-Jek and GrabBike are extending their price promos for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nStarting today, Go-Jek is introducing a slightly higher tariff of Rp 15k to take passengers anywhere in the capital.

The Indonesian start-up is taking the plunge after Uber Technologies, Inc. agreed in March to swap its Southeast Asian business for a 27.5% stake in Grab, thereby withdrawing from a hotly contested region of more than 600 million people.\\n\\nGo-Jek, whose backers include Warburg Pincus and KKR &amp; Co., has evolved from an app to book motorbike taxis to a way to pay bills, order food or buy movie tickets in Southeast Asia’s largest economy. It recently raised funds from investors including Google, Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Temasek Holdings Pte and was valued around $1.8 billion in 2016 by CB Insights.\\n\\n“Consumers are happiest when they have choice and at the moment, people in Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines don’t feel that they’re getting enough,” Go-Jek Chief Executive Officer Nadiem Makarim said in the statement. “We hope that as we arrive in new markets, we will quickly become everyone’s go-to lifestyle app.”\\n\\nGrab, aided by $4 billion raised from investors led by SoftBank Group Corp., has also pushed aggressively onto Go-Jek’s home turf.

It candidly stated: “In my opinion, if you are intolerant of diversity, you don’t really belong in GO-JEK.”\\n\\nJust a day after the post went viral, the hashtag #UninstallGojek began gaining traction on other social media platforms. Soon, people who strongly disagree with Go-Jek’s support of, and solidarity with, the LGBT+ community started sharing screenshots of them deleting the app from their phones.\\n\\nTwitter user @newsplatter tried to encourage doubters to keep a level-head, as other companies share similar sentiments and they’re not likely to stop using those for good.\\n\\n“I respect those who want to #UninstallGojek,” they wrote. “That is everyone’s right. But I also want to remind them to uninstall Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and don’t use Apple either — because as far as I know all those brands support LGBT rights.”\\n\\nIn a surprising turn of events though, Go-Jek reacted to the backlash by sharing a statement on its Twitter account that claimed the original Facebook post did not represent the entire company but rather “a personal opinion and interpretation of one of Go-Jek’s employees about an internal event with the theme of diversity,” according to The Jakarta Post.\\n\\nIt went on to clarify that while it does show consideration for diversity, it also respects “Indonesian values and culture”. It appears as if the Facebook post has now been deleted.\\n\\nHomosexuality is not illegal in Indonesia, unlike in other Southeast Asian nations. That being said, the country has seen a rise in anti-LGBT sentiment in recent years.</th>\n",

We will listen to what they have to offer,\" Lizada said.\\n\\nTNCs provide pre-arranged transportation services using internet-based applications or a digital platform, connecting passengers with drivers using their personal vehicles.\\n\\nBack in December 2017, Go-Jek chief technology officer Ajey Gore told Reuters in an interview that his firm is planning to set up operations in the Philippines early this year, with other Southeast Asian countries to follow in the next few months.\\n\\nGo-Jek, backed by private equity firms KKR &amp; Co LP and Warburg Pincus LLC, was established in 2010 as a motorcycle ride-hailing phone service. It then evolved into an on-demand mobile platform, providing transportation, logistics, mobile payments, and food delivery, among others.\\n\\nIn February this year, the dominant Indonesian ride-hailing firm was able to raise over $1.5 billion from investors like BlackRock and Google.\\n\\nMore local ride-hailing firms\\n\\nOther than Go-Jek, Lizada said there are two more local firms that have expressed interest in operating as a TNC: Cebu-based taxi-hailing platform MiCab and new ride-hailing firm Owto.\\n\\n\"Owto and MiCab are applying for [TNC accreditation], while U-Hop and Grab are applying for renewal of accreditation,\" Lizada told Rappler.\\n\\nShe added that the LTFRB is set to grant TNC accreditation to Hiro, another local ride-sharing firm.

Two years after it launched its ride-hailing app, it became a unicorn in the industry. Currently valued at about $5 billion, Go-Jek functions as a \"superapp,\" offering services ranging from rides, logistics, and bills payment, among others.\\n\\nOperating in 66 cities in Indonesia, it is backed by deep-pocketed investors in the tech scene such as Google, Chinese technology giants Tencent, and JD.com; as well as Singaporean investment company Temasek.\\n\\nGo-Jek seeks to expand to Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines by yearend as part of its $500-million overseas expansion. Go-Jek opened shop in Vietnam in August, capturing 35% of the market in just 6 weeks.\\n\\nIn the Philippines and the rest of Southeast Asia, Grab remains the dominant player for ride-hailing services, after Uber exited the region.\\n\\nThere are 7 other ride-hailing firms in the Philippines – Hype, Owto, Hirna, MiCab, Go Lag, ePickMeUp, and U-Hop – poised to challenge Grab but have been struggling to do so.\\n\\nThe entry of the new players was seen as an opportunity to break Grab's dominance in the country. Does Go-Jek stand a chance in the Philippine market?\\n\\nApplications in limbo?\\n\\nAs early as May, Go-Jek expressed interest to enter the Philippines and met with Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) officials.\\n\\nLTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada expressed concerns then, saying that the entry of a foreign firm \"would displace\" the new local transport network companies (TNCs). Go-Jek plans to introduce ride-hailing services for sedans, SUVs, AUVs, and taxis around Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao.\\n\\nThe LTFRB issued Memorandum Circular (MC) 2018-016 on August 9, freezing accreditation applications for new TNCs. It said it issued the order so it can focus on the pending applications and to monitor existing players.\\n\\nAs of the MC's publication, there were 5 firms listed vying for accreditation. Go-Jek was not on the list.\\n\\n\"All applicants with applications for TNC accreditation pending before the pre-accreditation committee are hereby directed to submit their complete and compliant requirements within 10 days of receipt or on August 5, whichever is later, otherwise their applications shall be denied by the committee,\" the order said.\\n\\nThe order was effective August 29.\\n\\nIn previous messages to the media, the LTFRB said that Go-Jek's application was \"on hold,\" as it passed its accreditation papers on August 13 – days after the memorandum circular was issued.\\n\\nRappler clarified this with LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III, noting that Go-Jek's submission date was before the MC's effectivity date.\\n\\nDelgra said that Go-Jek \"did not apply\" but Velox Technology Philippines did, along with two other firms. Velox is the local subsidiary of Go-Jek.\\n\\n\"The memorandum circular sets a deadline as to when they can file their accreditation requirements. They were able to make the cut. It is Velox applying,\" Delgra told Rappler in a phone interview.\\n\\nThe regulatory board chief said the fate of the applications rests on the pre-accreditation committee. There are 4 firms awaiting evaluation of the committee while one has a pending resolution on its application.\\n\\n\"The deliberations are ongoing. They are set to deliberate the first 4. The remaining 3 will be deliberated hopefully starting next year,\" Delgra said.\\n\\nMore competition\\n\\nSome local TNCs have expressed some reservation over the possible entry of another multibillion-dollar company in the Philippine ride-hailing market.\\n\\nBut Go-Jek believes that competition drives other firms to give better services to its customers.\\n\\n\"Go-Jek does not believe in a winner-takes-all approach to ride-hailing. That enough space exists for many different approaches and ideas from companies both large and small,\" Go-Jek said in a statement sent to Rappler.\\n\\n\"Smaller companies have more of a chance to succeed, learn, and grow in a competitive market, than a market with a single player controlling most of the market,\" it added.\\n\\nGo-Jek was awaiting for the LTFRB's green light \"before anything else,\" such as hiring employees for its local operations.\\n\\n\"Go-Jek is ready and waiting to provide the Philippines with a new mobility solution as soon as we are given the go-ahead,\" it said.\\n\\nEconomist JC Punongbayan said that Go-Jek's entry would be healthy for the market, given that new players have yet to make a difference in the market.\\n\\n\"We should actually embrace Go-Jek's entry as a way for our local competitors to innovate. It has been a major player in Indonesia for quite some time. It could bring its expertise in technology and inform policies,\" Punongbayan said.\\n\\nHe added that another big player would hopefully help bring down the average prices of ride-hailing services, as the firms would compete for riders.\\n\\nOn the part of the consumers, Laban Konsyumer Incorporated president Vic Dimagiba said that the best way is still to open up the market.\\n\\n\"If you really want the consumer to have better choices, then open up the market with those as good as Grab. But of course, we don't know yet what will happen to the smaller companies,\" Dimagiba, a former trade undersecretary, told Rappler.\\n\\nBring in what works\\n\\nWas the LTFRB right in freezing the accreditation application of TNCs? The antitrust body Philippine Competition Commission would agree on some points.\\n\\nPCC Commissioner Stella Quimbo acknowledged Grab's dominance over the 7 other local firms. Asked if another big player poses a threat to the smaller players, Quimbo said, \"There's no one to threaten.\"\\n\\n\"It's all speculative. At this point, who's going to be threatened? The 6 that can compete with Grab are not yet competing,\" she said.\\n\\nBut Quimbo pointed that the test of viability in the market is important, and that might mean looking for other options outside the country.\\n\\n\"We want entry plus viability. [But] what's the test for viability? In the history of the Philippines, we've only had two viable ones. If you want to look for an alternative that is also viable, we have no choice but to look outside of the country,\" Quimbo said.\\n\\nIn August, the PCC approved Grab's acquisition of Uber, but has bound the former to fair pricing conditions and service quality commitments.\\n\\nThe antitrust body may release Grab from the commitments if there is already \"sufficient competition in the market.\" Quimbo said, however, that the PCC can still hold Grab accountable \"if they abuse their dominance\" after the commitment period.\\n\\nThe LTFRB said that Go-Jek's application may be reviewed in 2019. This would mean more time for the consumers to wait for another option on the same scale as Grab.\\n\\nAs the new TNCs continue to adjust to the challenges of the ride-hailing market, until when will Filipinos wait for a viable option? – Rappler.com</th>\n",

REUTERS/Darren Whiteside\\n\\nLaunched in 2011 in Jakarta, Go-Jek - a play on the local word for motorbike taxis - has evolved from a ride-hailing service to a one-stop app allowing clients in Southeast Asia’s largest economy to make online payments and order everything from food, groceries to massages.\\n\\n“We’re seeing enormous online to offline traction for all of our businesses and are close to being profitable, outside of transportation,” said the 34-year old CEO.\\n\\nThe startup is expected to be fully profitable “probably” within the next few years, Makarim added.\\n\\nAlready a market leader in Indonesia, where it processes more than 100 million transactions for its 20-25 million monthly users, Go-Jek is now looking to expand in Southeast Asia.\\n\\nRide hailing services in Southeast Asia are expected to surge to $20.1 billion in gross merchandise value by 2025 from $5.1 billion in 2017, according to a Google-Temasek report.\\n\\nGo-Jek said in May it would invest $500 million to enter Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines, after Uber [UBER.UL] struck a deal to sell its Southeast Asian operations to Grab - the bigger player in the region.\\n\\nGo-Jek is seeing strong funding interest from its backers as it targets an aggressive expansion, Makarim said.\\n\\n“Since its Aug. 1 launch, the app has already grabbed 15 percent of market share in Ho Chi Minh,” Makarim said. The firm this week opened recruitment for motorcycle drivers in Thailand.\\n\\nThe startup expects anti-monopoly concerns swirling around the Grab-Uber deal, which Singapore said had substantially hurt competition, to help clear a path for its expansion.\\n\\n“We’re bringing back choice. The Singapore government is particularly eager to bring back competition,” Makarim said, adding that the order of overseas rollouts had not been set.\\n\\nOVERSEAS PUSH\\n\\nGo-Jek’s offshore push comes at a time when Singapore-based Grab is stepping up funding to expand in Indonesia and transform itself into a consumer technology company, starting with a partnership with online grocer HappyFresh.\\n\\n“Mimicking Go-Jek’s strategy is the highest form of flattery,” laughed Makarim.\\n\\nGrab told Reuters in a statement, “The super app strategy has been around for a while now and no Southeast Asian player can claim to have pioneered it.” The company also said Grab has not lost market share in Ho Chi Minh since August, but declined to provide market share data.\\n\\nMakarim believes Go-Jek’s understanding of food merchants will give it an edge over Grab, which counts investors such as Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing and Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp among its backers.\\n\\nMakarim, who sees food delivery as Go-Jek’s core business, said he was not concerned about funding, without giving details.\\n\\nSlideshow (2 Images)\\n\\nGo-Jek was reported in June as being in talks to raise $1.5 billion in a new funding round and was valued at about $5 billion in a prior fundraising, sources have told Reuters.

The company is collaborating with Alphabet Inc’s Google on platform mobility, Tencent on payments strategy, JD.com on logistics operations, and Meituan Dianping on merchant transactions and deliveries.\\n\\nGo-Jek has set up a venture capital arm, Go-Ventures, to invest in startups in Southeast Asia “with strategic importance to our business”, the CEO said.</th>\n",

       "      <th>There is a different kind of vibe in the newly furbished GO-JEK office in Bengaluru. After all, one of the biggest startup businesses of Indonesia just set up its engineering base in the city.\\n\\nThe man of the hour, GO-JEK founder and CEO Nadiem Makarim, sits at the conference table along with the founders of Indian startups he has acquired.\\n\\nIn Q4 2015, the on-demand services behemoth had acquired web-applications and devops startups C42 and CodeIgnition. These were followed by the purchases of healthcare startup Pianta and, more recently, Pune-based Leftshift technologies.\\n\\nToday, the founders of these startups are core members of GO-JEK’s tech leadership. Having worked with these startups as technology contractors, Nadiem says that it was these acquisitions that led them to the decision of making India their engineering base.\\n\\nThis tech aggression seems like the need of the hour, with the company witnessing exponential growth that no one, including GO-JEK’s investors, saw coming. From the launch of their app in 2015, the firm quickly scaled to 26 million downloads, completing 100 million bookings (till Q2 of 2016) and spreading their wings across 15 verticals from food couriering to home services.\\n\\nAnd all wasn’t well.\\n\\nThis fast-paced scaling catapulted into complaints about the app framework. In an earlier interview, Nadiem was quoted saying that the company grew so fast that they lost control of how many people downloaded their app, grossly underestimating their own growth rate.\\n\\nBut don’t take them lightly. Having already scaled to a team of 109 engineers, Nadiem says that they’d allow only the best of the best to be a part of the regime. To quantify it, he says,\\n\\n“Only five percent of the total applicant base really makes it to the grind.”\\n\\nIn addition to their in-house strength, the company continues to work with 15 technology contractors, and Nadiem’s answer to any kind of acqui-hiring is straightforward. He says,\\n\\nThe philosophy is simple - we will continue to grow either through acquiring or organic hiring.\\n\\nGoing to his roots\\n\\nSo, how did a business that was started on the sidelines grow into a well fed multi-sectoral giant in Indonesia? The answer lies in Nadiem’s journey.\\n\\nAfter his stint in Brown University, Nadiem joined the consulting behemoth McKinsey &amp; Co. There, he kick-started an initiative under the name Young Leaders of Indonesia. The initiative was not just a step for him to learn about the world of entrepreneurship, but also got him into the prestigious Harvard Business School. This education paved the way for his journey into the startup world.\\n\\nAfter a stint of building Rocket Internet in Indonesia, Nadiem tried his hand at several ventures. Most failed, but, surprisingly, GO-JEK stuck.\\n\\nWhile in Indonesia, he did quite a bit of travelling through indigenous bike taxis called Ojeks. Not relying on them solely for transportation, he also used the taxis for services involving buying food or even delivering couriers.\\n\\nAnd that seems to have struck a chord, prompting Nadiem to look into opportunities in the space.\\n\\nStarting up, the idea was to channelise the market by introducing a call centre, requesting ojek drivers to pick up customers on-demand and transport them. At that time, he did not quite realise the potential of what he was building. The company managed quick organic growth.\\n\\nBig rivals come knocking\\n\\nThings, however, formalised in 2014 with the entrance of Uber and GrabTaxi; the latter a firm run by his good friend at Harvard and now arch-rival Anthony Tan. When GrabTaxi (now called Grab) was planning to enter the bike taxi market in Indonesia, they had a cumulative funding of $250 million, while GO-JEK had only $2 million in investments.\\n\\nThings quickly changed and investor interest started peaking. Some attention also came the way of GO-JEK, and Nadiem knew that this was a wave he wanted to ride.\\n\\nBeing a call centre service up till 2014, GO-JEK quickly moved forward with the launch of their app in 2015, aggressively taking the stance of a mobile-first company.\\n\\nToday, GO-JEK claims to be an Indonesian market leader across several of their verticals - Go-Car (launched in April this year); Go-Food (food delivery); Go-Mart (online shopping); Go- Send (their courier service); Go-Box (their courier service for large scale businesses); Go-Clean (home services); Go-Med (medicine prescription delivery) and many more. The company is aggressively pushing their wallet Go-Pay, currently in the user acquisition phase, with plans to open it to the market in a few months.\\n\\nNadiem says,\\n\\nThe closest business model we come to is China’s WeChat, but unlike WeChat, here we also own the complete supply chain of the products endorsed and provided on our platform.\\n\\nBuilding the Indonesian behemoth\\n\\nIn August this year, the GO-JEK group closed a massive funding round of $550 million, valuing the company at almost $1.3 billion. This is the largest ever valuation for an Indonesian technology startup.\\n\\nThe new round of funding was led by KKR &amp; Co. and Warburg Pincus LLC, with the likes of Sequoia Capital, DST Global and Singapore-based NSI Ventures already among GO-JEK’s existing investors.\\n\\nAnd why not? With a strong network of more than 240,000 drivers across 15 Indonesian cities, the GO-JEK app has seen more than 26 million downloads and 100 million bookings since its launch.\\n\\nTo provide an idea of the company’s growth, in December 2014, the company was a network of barely 600 drivers, with 16,000 customers and 70 corporate clients. By the end of 2015, the firm claimed to be pushing out 340,000 orders a day. That is nothing less than a massive leap from where they started.\\n\\nA simple formula for success\\n\\nToday, their food delivery business, Go-Food, has 40,000 restaurants listed on its platform, and their hyperlocal business, Go-mart, has 50 different types of stores available. Alone, in 18 months, the firm has processed 50 million orders, far bigger than any Indian counterpart, including Swiggy, which has just 5,000 restaurants on its platform (as of April 2016).\\n\\nExplaining the reason for the upswing, Nadiem comments,\\n\\nYou see, we weren’t ever teaching people to do something new. Rather, the best way to put it is that we were optimising the way these people did it.\\n\\nUsing ojeks was always a big part of Indonesian culture, and GO-JEK believes that they just added a layer of convenience to it. This is quite contrary to Indian markets, where players had to push customers into habituation.\\n\\nHowever, with such scale, Nadiem still believes that they will be maintaining their focus on Indonesia. He adds,\\n\\nThe Indonesian market is huge, with the per capita spend and mobile penetration being extremely high. Higher than most South-Asian markets. Looking at this opportunity, I am sure that, eventually, there will be more and more billion-dollar companies entering the market. At that point, we would like to hold on to our competitive edge, while being real market leaders in the segments we function in.\\n\\nAnd Nadiem lays it down simply that there have been just two basic things that have led to GO-JEK’s success – their team and the innate culture of taking risks.\\n\\nThe news of GO-JEK opening its engineering centre in India comes as proof of the strong technology talent pool that the country has to offer. After biggies like Twitter and Ebay announcing their exits, the global unicorns seem to be milking the technology base of the world’s second largest startup market.\\n\\nWe can, therefore, say with confidence that good times are down the road!</th>\n",

       "      <th>After Dunzo, Google now invests in Indonesian ride-hailing platform Go-Jek</th>\n",
       "      <th>Google on Monday said it has invested in Indonesian ride-sharing platform Go-Jek along with Singapore’s Temasek and China’s Meituan - Dianping. A report in TechCrunch said Google, Temasek, and Meituan - Dianping, were a part of the tranche of $1.2 billion that the ride-hailing platform was working on since last April.\\n\\nThe current valuation of Go-Jek now stands at $4 billion, and this is Google’s first direct investment in Indonesia. This announcement comes a month after its first direct investment in India, Dunzo, in December last year. This investment by Google also falls under the next billion initiative.\\n\\nIn its blog, Google said:\\n\\n“Indonesia already has a thriving internet economy, and a bustling startup scene, home to four of Southeast Asia’s eight “unicorns,” but we’d like to do more to help supercharge and grow with it. So, to help Indonesians build the next great startup, we’ve already trained nearly 60,000 Indonesians on mobile app development, toward our goal of reaching 100,000 developers by 2020. And to help more Indonesian small businesses tap into the power of the internet, our Gapura Digital initiative has trained more than 40,000 small business owners in 10 cities, with more cities to come.”\\n\\nThus, while Dara Khosrowshahi, might call India and Southeast Asia unprofitable, these regions seem to be biggest markets and have seen the largest growth. The TechCrunch article stated ride-hailing in Southeast Asia is set to become a $20.1 billion market by 2025, going up from $5.1 billion in 2017.\\n\\nIndonesia, the report states, will own close to 40 percent of the revenue. After India, Indonesia is the second country globally to get a ‘Google Station.’ The Google Blog also stated:\\n\\n“We have also designed products to work for Indonesians. YouTube Go helps Indonesians watch their favourite videos even with poor connectivity. And most recently, Indonesia was one of the first two countries in the world to get our new app, Google Go, which makes searching the internet faster and simpler for Indonesians on slow connections.”\\n\\nThe reason Google invested in Go-Jek is that the company is led by a strong management team, and has a proven track record of using technology to make life simple. The blog said:\\n\\n“By investing in local companies, building locally relevant products and training local talent, we hope to see more amazing local champions like Go-Jek emerge in Indonesia. As always, we’re driven and inspired by our users and partners and are always on the the lookout for more opportunities to support them.”\\n\\nCurrently active in Indonesia alone, Go-Jek’s bike taxis and hyperlocal services are giving tough competition to the likes of Grab and Uber.\\n\\nWebsite</th>\n",

       "      <th>BENGALURU: Indonesia’s bike taxi service Go-Jek , one of the most watched startups in Southeast Asia, is setting up a development centre in India by acquiring two local companies — Bengaluru-based software engineering company C42 Engineering and Delhi-based CodeIgnition.The deal is aimed at helping Go-Jek set up a research &amp; development (R&amp;D) center in Bengaluru, where it plans to recruit over 100 senior engineers in the next six months. Size or structure of the transactions was not disclosed.Go-Jek, which is backed by Sequoia Capital India and Yuri Milner’s DST Global, zeroed in on the Indian companies while searching for a solution to a software bug that hit its mobile application.“We lost control over our growth then our investor Sequoia extended a helping hand by introducing us to founders of C42 and CodeIgnition, they saved us from imploding,” said Nadiem Makarim, the Jakarta-based founder of Go-Jek. The company’s mobile application downloads have grown to 11million since it was launched in January 2015.Makarim said that Go-Jek has become the largest consumer-internet company in Indonesia on parameters like number of transactions, funding raised and valuation.He declined to disclose any numbers, and the company had not even formally announced its financing rounds from Sequoia and DST Global, so far.Having begun as a bike taxi business, Go-Jek has diversified into food delivery, one-hour courier delivery, grocery delivery and even has aggregated trucks on its platform.It has partnered with 2,00,000 motorcycle drivers and 5,000 trucks across Indonesia, claiming that daily transaction volumes have gone up over a hundredfold in the last six months.“We have more vehicles than Uber has in the US, and we are the largest online food delivery company outside the US and China,” said Makarim, a Harvard Business School MBA who has worked at consulting firm McKinsey and Germany’s internet accelerator Rocket Internet.“We are all online and offline businesses rolled up into one, which is unlike India and China where things are fairly specialised,” said Makarim, adding that Go-Jek is a mix of Ola, Zomato, Tinyowl, Grofers and few other startups rolled into one given the cross selling opportunities.Experts tracking the cross border M&amp;A space said that this is a first of its kind acquisition from a South East Asian internet company. “We have seen interest from the US companies to set up development centres here through acquisitions here, not Asian companies,” said Sanat Rao, M&amp;A adviser at software product think tank iSPIRT.C42 Engineering, which has worked with Indian e-tailers like Flipkart ad Urbanladder, was founded in 2010 as a boutique ruby and rails consultancy. Its founders include former software consulting firm Thoughtworks execs Sidu Ponnappa and Niranjan Paranjape, and restaurant review platform Burrp’s alumni Aakash Dharmadhikari.</th>\n",

Hampir 500.000 lebih sudah mengikuti program GO-JEK SWADAYA.\\n\\nVice President of Drivers Community GO-JEK Indonesia Jaka Wiradisuria mengatakan, untuk wilayah Bali, pihaknya bekerja sama dengan industri perbankan seperti BTN untuk cicilan KPR, BNI Syariah untuk tabungan umrah, dan program proteksi dari Pasar Polis. Sebelum ada program GO-JEK SWADAYA, mitra driver kerap kesulitan mengajukan bantuan pembiayaan tersebut.\\n\\nDia mencontohkan saat ini mitra driver yang ingin memiliki rumah idaman dapat memanfaatkan skema cicilan Kredit Perumahan Rakyat (KPR) harian. Hanya dengan Rp48.000 per hari, para mitra driver dapat memiliki rumah idaman mereka. Para mitra driver dapat dengan mudah memanfaatkan program GO-JEK SWADAYA yang ada pada aplikasi driver mereka untuk mengajukan kredit pemilikan rumah (KPR).\\n\\n\"Ini membuktikan bahwa para mitra driver Bali dapat menikmati semua akses finansial yang sebelumnya sulit bagi mereka,\" katanya, Jumat (31/8/2018).\\n\\nMenurut Jaka, mitra driver juga mendapatkan akses proteksi finansial terjangkau, mulai dari asuransi kesehatan on-trip dan off-trip bagi mitra dan keluarga melalui kerja sama dengan Allianz. Selain itu, ada jaminan barang pribadi dan perlindungan kecelakaan melalui kerja sama dengan Pasar Polis, serta jaminan hari tua melalui kerja sama dengan BPJS Ketenagakerjaan.\\n\\n\"Hadirnya kami di 66 kota di Indonesia juga membuka jalan seluas-luasnya pada peningkatan inklusi finansial di kalangan mitra pengemudi,” katanya.</th>\n",

On average, fines were Rp 2 million per driver.

He said drivers suddenly received text messages with no warnings or explanations about fines they were given.\\n\\nApparently not so many drivers were thrilled with this turn of events so they took to the streets to protest to Go-Jek and demand further explanations for their fines and suspensions.\\n\\nGo-Jek has not yet made a public statement to the press about the demo.</th>\n",

Karena mereka menjatuhkan harga pasaran,\" ketus dia saat berbincang dengan Liputan6.com di pangkalan ojek Senayan, Minggu (14/6/2015).\\n\\n\\n\\nDijelaskannya, Go-Jek menggunakan sistem tarif per kilometer (km). Setiap satu km dipungut tarif Rp 4.000. Jadi dengan rute Senayan-Depok, Go-Jek hanya mengenakan tarif Rp 76 ribu per orang.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Kemarin teman saya yang bergabung di Go-Jek narik Senayan-Depok dapat uang Rp 76 ribu. Lalu dipotong kantornya 20 persen, sisanya buat teman saya,\" terang Yosi.\\n\\n\\n\\nSementara Yosi mengenakan tarif standar, seperti Senayan-Kemang Rp 30 ribu, Senayan-Blok M Rp 20 ribu. Itupun diakuinya penumpang masih saja menawar harga. Yosi memasang tarif tinggi atau mencapai dua kali lipat, apabila terjebak pada situasi dan kondisi macet serta banjir.\\n\\n\\n\\nApalagi, tegas dia, perusahaan yang menaungi para ojek online ini tengah memberlakukan tarif promo Rp 10 ribu kemanapun tujuannya. Artinya mau jurusan darimana dan kemana saja, Go-Jek hanya mengenakan tarif Rp 10 ribu per orang.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mau ke Bekasi, Depok atau lainnya cuma dipungut Rp 10 ribu selama Ramadan. Ini kan menjatuhkan harga sekali, masa kita harus nyamain mereka. Tekor dong,\" ucapnya.\\n\\n\\n\\nFenomena kehadiran Go-Jek, diakui dia, semakin membuat keberadaan ojek-ojek pangkalan tergusur. Pendapatan merosot, dan terkadang penumpang ojek pangkalan diserobot Go-Jek.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Langganan banyak yang kabur pakai Go-Jek, dari 7 orang langganan, sekarang saya cuma pegang 3 orang. Penghasilan pun turun dari biasanya Rp 100 ribu per hari, jadi cuma Rp 50 ribu-Rp 80 ribu,\" tutur Yosi. (Fik/Ndw)</th>\n",

       "      <th>GO-JEK, Indonesia’s first billion-dollar startup, will invest $500 million to expand ride-hailing and other services to four Southeast Asian countries, taking advantage of Uber’s pullout from the region to make its first international foray.\\n\\nThe Jakarta-based company will enter Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines in coming months, starting with ride-hailing but with the aim of replicating the multiple services it offers back home, it said in an e-mailed statement.\\n\\nThat will pit Go-Jek directly against larger rival Grab, including in the latter’s home market of Singapore. The Indonesian start-up is taking the plunge after Uber Technologies, Inc. agreed in March to swap its Southeast Asian business for a 27.5% stake in Grab, thereby withdrawing from a hotly contested region of more than 600 million people.\\n\\nGo-Jek, whose backers include Warburg Pincus and KKR &amp; Co., has evolved from an app to book motorbike taxis to a way to pay bills, order food or buy movie tickets in Southeast Asia’s largest economy. It recently raised funds from investors including Google, Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Temasek Holdings Pte and was valued around $1.8 billion in 2016 by CB Insights.\\n\\n“Consumers are happiest when they have choice and at the moment, people in Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines don’t feel that they’re getting enough,” Go-Jek Chief Executive Officer Nadiem Makarim said in the statement. “We hope that as we arrive in new markets, we will quickly become everyone’s go-to lifestyle app.”\\n\\nGrab, aided by $4 billion raised from investors led by SoftBank Group Corp., has also pushed aggressively onto Go-Jek’s home turf. Grab already operates in seven countries and is run by Anthony Tan, Makarim’s former classmate at Harvard Business School. — Bloomberg</th>\n",

Size or structure of the transactions was not disclosed.Go-Jek, which is backed by Sequoia Capital India and Yuri Milner’s DST Global, zeroed in on the Indian companies while searching for a solution to a software bug that hit its mobile application.“We lost control over our growth then our investor Sequoia extended a helping hand by introducing us to founders of C42 and CodeIgnition, they saved us from imploding,” said Nadiem Makarim, the Jakarta-based founder of Go-Jek. The company’s mobile application downloads have grown to 11million since it was launched in January 2015.Makarim said that Go-Jek has become the largest consumer-internet company in Indonesia on parameters like number of transactions, funding raised and valuation.He declined to disclose any numbers, and the company had not even formally announced its financing rounds from Sequoia and DST Global, so far. Having begun as a biketaxi business, Go-Jek has diversified into food delivery, one-hour courier delivery, grocery delivery and even has aggregated trucks on its platform. It has partnered with 2,00,000 motorcycle drivers and 5,000 trucks across Indonesia, claiming that daily transaction volumes have gone up over a hundredfold in the last six months.“We have more vehicles than Uber has in the US, and we are the largest online food delivery company outside the US and China,” said Makarim, a Harvard Business School MBA who has worked at consulting firm McKinsey and Germany’s internet accelerator Rocket Internet.“We are all online and offline businesses rolled up into one, which is unlike India and China where things are fairly specialised,” said Makarim, adding that Go-Jek is a mix of Ola, Zomato, Tinyowl, Grofers and few other startups rolled into one given the cross selling opportunities.Experts tracking the cross border M&amp;A space said that this is a first of its kind acquisition from a South East Asian internet company. “We have seen interest from the US companies to set up development centres here through acquisitions here, not Asian companies,” said Sanat Rao, M&amp;A adviser at software product think tank iSPIRT.C42 Engineering, which has worked with Indian etailers like Flipkart ad Urbanladder, was founded in 2010 as a boutique ruby and rails consultancy. Its founders include former software consulting firm Thoughtworks execs Sidu Ponnappa and Niranjan Paranjape, and restaurant review platform Burrp’s alumni Aakash Dharmadhikari.</th>\n",

Photo: Reddit/Roflpaladin\\n\\nSince its smartphone application debuted early this year, motorcycle taxi service Go-Jek has quickly become an integral part of Jakarta’s transportation network. This has led to numerous clashes with traditional ojek drivers that have been covered extensively in the media (there’s a particularly illuminating article on the subject from Tech in Asia).\\n\\nThe government and police have promised to protect Go-Jek drivers from other ojek drivers who attack or intimidate them for working in their territory, but there had been little evidence of that protection reported in the media so far.\\n\\nBut now some Go-Jek drivers are claiming that the police are backing them up in a big way – by sending undercover officers to crack down on places where traditional ojeks have organized against the new guard.\\n\\n“Now we are receiving back up from members of Brimob (Mobile Brigade Police). So at vulnerable points, there are members of Brimob disguised in civilian clothes,” Faridz Budhi a 33 year old Go-Jek driver, told Kompas on Sunday.\\n\\nFaridz said he felt a lot safer now when entering areas that were previously prone to intimidation against Go-Jeks, though he said he had never experienced any harassment directly since he started the Go-Jek gig a month ago.\\n\\nAnother Go-Jek driver, Helmi Can, echoed Faridz sentiments, saying, “We have been told about this. We have backup from Brimob, so there is no need to worry.”\\n\\nWhile it would certainly be good if the police were making such an effort to protect Go-Jek drivers from intimidation and abuse, the police themselves have not confirmed an operation like the Go-Jek drivers described.\\n\\nWhen asked by Kompas, Jakarta Police Chief Tito Karnavian claimed not to know anything about it.\\n\\n“I have not heard of (Brimob members providing backup for Go-Jeks),” Tito said yesterday.\\n\\nBut the police chief said that his officers would of course take action against any criminal actions by ojeks, regardless of the victims.\\n\\nSo are the Go-Jek drivers misinformed? Or are the police actually just not telling the media about an ongoing undercover operation? We’ll just have to wait and see how much worse the battle of old and new will get.</th>\n",

They’ll look at you wide-eyed in disbelief, and then shrug their shoulders and say “Who cares, grandpa?” before flying away on their Go-Jet.\\n\\nAt any rate, it’s a good time to be an ojek rider in Jakarta, as the two giants of the emergent online ojek industry, local outfit Go-Jek and Malaysia-based GrabBike, battle for the hearts of customers in Indonesia.\\n\\nFor quite a while, both companies have been offering absurdly low promo rates for customers to get them hooked on their services, with Go-Jek introducing a Rp 10k flat rate promo during Ramadan and GrabBike offering an even more ridiculously rate of Rp 5k, with the companies picking up the rest of the bill.\\n\\nAnalysts were wondering what would happen when both companies returned to their normal per-kilometer pricing structures and how many customers they would hang on to. But it looks like we won’t find out for a while, as both Go-Jek and GrabBike are extending their price promos for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nStarting today, Go-Jek is introducing a slightly higher tariff of Rp 15k to take passengers anywhere in the capital. Courier and delivery services remain Rp 10k. No end date has been announced for this promo.\\n\\nHai GO-JEKERS!

For now, the customers are the winners.\\n\\nWe do feel somewhat sorry for the old-school ojeks, who have no way of competing against Go-Jek or GrabBike on price point. No wonder they’re so pissed at the new upstarts. But even the most stubborn ojek may soon be forced to join one of the big two if they want to keep making a living.</th>\n",

The Indonesian start-up is taking the plunge after Uber Technologies, Inc. agreed in March to swap its Southeast Asian business for a 27.5% stake in Grab, thereby withdrawing from a hotly contested region of more than 600 million people.\\n\\nGo-Jek, whose backers include Warburg Pincus and KKR &amp; Co., has evolved from an app to book motorbike taxis to a way to pay bills, order food or buy movie tickets in Southeast Asia’s largest economy. It recently raised funds from investors including Google, Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Temasek Holdings Pte and was valued around $1.8 billion in 2016 by CB Insights.\\n\\n“Consumers are happiest when they have choice and at the moment, people in Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines don’t feel that they’re getting enough,” Go-Jek Chief Executive Officer Nadiem Makarim said in the statement. “We hope that as we arrive in new markets, we will quickly become everyone’s go-to lifestyle app.”\\n\\nGrab, aided by $4 billion raised from investors led by SoftBank Group Corp., has also pushed aggressively onto Go-Jek’s home turf.

It candidly stated: “In my opinion, if you are intolerant of diversity, you don’t really belong in GO-JEK.”\\n\\nJust a day after the post went viral, the hashtag #UninstallGojek began gaining traction on other social media platforms. Soon, people who strongly disagree with Go-Jek’s support of, and solidarity with, the LGBT+ community started sharing screenshots of them deleting the app from their phones.\\n\\nTwitter user @newsplatter tried to encourage doubters to keep a level-head, as other companies share similar sentiments and they’re not likely to stop using those for good.\\n\\n“I respect those who want to #UninstallGojek,” they wrote. “That is everyone’s right. But I also want to remind them to uninstall Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and don’t use Apple either — because as far as I know all those brands support LGBT rights.”\\n\\nIn a surprising turn of events though, Go-Jek reacted to the backlash by sharing a statement on its Twitter account that claimed the original Facebook post did not represent the entire company but rather “a personal opinion and interpretation of one of Go-Jek’s employees about an internal event with the theme of diversity,” according to The Jakarta Post.\\n\\nIt went on to clarify that while it does show consideration for diversity, it also respects “Indonesian values and culture”. It appears as if the Facebook post has now been deleted.\\n\\nHomosexuality is not illegal in Indonesia, unlike in other Southeast Asian nations. That being said, the country has seen a rise in anti-LGBT sentiment in recent years.</th>\n",

We will listen to what they have to offer,\" Lizada said.\\n\\nTNCs provide pre-arranged transportation services using internet-based applications or a digital platform, connecting passengers with drivers using their personal vehicles.\\n\\nBack in December 2017, Go-Jek chief technology officer Ajey Gore told Reuters in an interview that his firm is planning to set up operations in the Philippines early this year, with other Southeast Asian countries to follow in the next few months.\\n\\nGo-Jek, backed by private equity firms KKR &amp; Co LP and Warburg Pincus LLC, was established in 2010 as a motorcycle ride-hailing phone service. It then evolved into an on-demand mobile platform, providing transportation, logistics, mobile payments, and food delivery, among others.\\n\\nIn February this year, the dominant Indonesian ride-hailing firm was able to raise over $1.5 billion from investors like BlackRock and Google.\\n\\nMore local ride-hailing firms\\n\\nOther than Go-Jek, Lizada said there are two more local firms that have expressed interest in operating as a TNC: Cebu-based taxi-hailing platform MiCab and new ride-hailing firm Owto.\\n\\n\"Owto and MiCab are applying for [TNC accreditation], while U-Hop and Grab are applying for renewal of accreditation,\" Lizada told Rappler.\\n\\nShe added that the LTFRB is set to grant TNC accreditation to Hiro, another local ride-sharing firm.

The antitrust watchdog had also ordered Grab and Uber to explain why the latter shut down, despite the commission ordering it to continue operating while the review is ongoing.\\n\\nGrab Philippines head Brian Cu called on the PCC to discuss the matter with them further, saying that keeping the Uber app functioning indefinitely would be costly. – Rappler.com</th>\n",

Two years after it launched its ride-hailing app, it became a unicorn in the industry. Currently valued at about $5 billion, Go-Jek functions as a \"superapp,\" offering services ranging from rides, logistics, and bills payment, among others.\\n\\nOperating in 66 cities in Indonesia, it is backed by deep-pocketed investors in the tech scene such as Google, Chinese technology giants Tencent, and JD.com; as well as Singaporean investment company Temasek.\\n\\nGo-Jek seeks to expand to Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines by yearend as part of its $500-million overseas expansion. Go-Jek opened shop in Vietnam in August, capturing 35% of the market in just 6 weeks.\\n\\nIn the Philippines and the rest of Southeast Asia, Grab remains the dominant player for ride-hailing services, after Uber exited the region.\\n\\nThere are 7 other ride-hailing firms in the Philippines – Hype, Owto, Hirna, MiCab, Go Lag, ePickMeUp, and U-Hop – poised to challenge Grab but have been struggling to do so.\\n\\nThe entry of the new players was seen as an opportunity to break Grab's dominance in the country. Does Go-Jek stand a chance in the Philippine market?\\n\\nApplications in limbo?\\n\\nAs early as May, Go-Jek expressed interest to enter the Philippines and met with Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) officials.\\n\\nLTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada expressed concerns then, saying that the entry of a foreign firm \"would displace\" the new local transport network companies (TNCs). Go-Jek plans to introduce ride-hailing services for sedans, SUVs, AUVs, and taxis around Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao.\\n\\nThe LTFRB issued Memorandum Circular (MC) 2018-016 on August 9, freezing accreditation applications for new TNCs. It said it issued the order so it can focus on the pending applications and to monitor existing players.\\n\\nAs of the MC's publication, there were 5 firms listed vying for accreditation. Go-Jek was not on the list.\\n\\n\"All applicants with applications for TNC accreditation pending before the pre-accreditation committee are hereby directed to submit their complete and compliant requirements within 10 days of receipt or on August 5, whichever is later, otherwise their applications shall be denied by the committee,\" the order said.\\n\\nThe order was effective August 29.\\n\\nIn previous messages to the media, the LTFRB said that Go-Jek's application was \"on hold,\" as it passed its accreditation papers on August 13 – days after the memorandum circular was issued.\\n\\nRappler clarified this with LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III, noting that Go-Jek's submission date was before the MC's effectivity date.\\n\\nDelgra said that Go-Jek \"did not apply\" but Velox Technology Philippines did, along with two other firms. Velox is the local subsidiary of Go-Jek.\\n\\n\"The memorandum circular sets a deadline as to when they can file their accreditation requirements. They were able to make the cut. It is Velox applying,\" Delgra told Rappler in a phone interview.\\n\\nThe regulatory board chief said the fate of the applications rests on the pre-accreditation committee. There are 4 firms awaiting evaluation of the committee while one has a pending resolution on its application.\\n\\n\"The deliberations are ongoing. They are set to deliberate the first 4. The remaining 3 will be deliberated hopefully starting next year,\" Delgra said.\\n\\nMore competition\\n\\nSome local TNCs have expressed some reservation over the possible entry of another multibillion-dollar company in the Philippine ride-hailing market.\\n\\nBut Go-Jek believes that competition drives other firms to give better services to its customers.\\n\\n\"Go-Jek does not believe in a winner-takes-all approach to ride-hailing. That enough space exists for many different approaches and ideas from companies both large and small,\" Go-Jek said in a statement sent to Rappler.\\n\\n\"Smaller companies have more of a chance to succeed, learn, and grow in a competitive market, than a market with a single player controlling most of the market,\" it added.\\n\\nGo-Jek was awaiting for the LTFRB's green light \"before anything else,\" such as hiring employees for its local operations.\\n\\n\"Go-Jek is ready and waiting to provide the Philippines with a new mobility solution as soon as we are given the go-ahead,\" it said.\\n\\nEconomist JC Punongbayan said that Go-Jek's entry would be healthy for the market, given that new players have yet to make a difference in the market.\\n\\n\"We should actually embrace Go-Jek's entry as a way for our local competitors to innovate. It has been a major player in Indonesia for quite some time. It could bring its expertise in technology and inform policies,\" Punongbayan said.\\n\\nHe added that another big player would hopefully help bring down the average prices of ride-hailing services, as the firms would compete for riders.\\n\\nOn the part of the consumers, Laban Konsyumer Incorporated president Vic Dimagiba said that the best way is still to open up the market.\\n\\n\"If you really want the consumer to have better choices, then open up the market with those as good as Grab. But of course, we don't know yet what will happen to the smaller companies,\" Dimagiba, a former trade undersecretary, told Rappler.\\n\\nBring in what works\\n\\nWas the LTFRB right in freezing the accreditation application of TNCs? The antitrust body Philippine Competition Commission would agree on some points.\\n\\nPCC Commissioner Stella Quimbo acknowledged Grab's dominance over the 7 other local firms. Asked if another big player poses a threat to the smaller players, Quimbo said, \"There's no one to threaten.\"\\n\\n\"It's all speculative. At this point, who's going to be threatened? The 6 that can compete with Grab are not yet competing,\" she said.\\n\\nBut Quimbo pointed that the test of viability in the market is important, and that might mean looking for other options outside the country.\\n\\n\"We want entry plus viability. [But] what's the test for viability? In the history of the Philippines, we've only had two viable ones. If you want to look for an alternative that is also viable, we have no choice but to look outside of the country,\" Quimbo said.\\n\\nIn August, the PCC approved Grab's acquisition of Uber, but has bound the former to fair pricing conditions and service quality commitments.\\n\\nThe antitrust body may release Grab from the commitments if there is already \"sufficient competition in the market.\" Quimbo said, however, that the PCC can still hold Grab accountable \"if they abuse their dominance\" after the commitment period.\\n\\nThe LTFRB said that Go-Jek's application may be reviewed in 2019. This would mean more time for the consumers to wait for another option on the same scale as Grab.\\n\\nAs the new TNCs continue to adjust to the challenges of the ride-hailing market, until when will Filipinos wait for a viable option? – Rappler.com</th>\n",

       "      <th>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian ride-hailing app Go-Jek will expand into Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore and the Philippines in the next few months, it said Thursday, stepping up competition with rival Grab for Southeast Asian customers.\\n\\nGo-Jek, which currently only operates in Indonesia, said it will spend $500 million on the regional expansion. It’s potentially good news for consumers in Southeast Asia after competition between ride-hailing apps lessened with Uber’s agreement in March to sell its failing business in the region to Singapore-based Grab.\\n\\nGo-Jek, which got a cash injection from investors including Google and Tencent earlier this year, said its overseas businesses will initially focus on ride hailing but eventually expand to other services such as food delivery.\\n\\nIt said it wants to replicate the dominance it has achieved in Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s most populous nation and biggest economy. Go-Jek, a play on “ojek,” the Indonesian word for motorcycle taxi, has been embraced by citydwellers in Indonesia as a solution to chronically congested roads.\\n\\nBoth it and Grab are trying to extract more revenue from their ride-hailing customers by transforming their apps into one-stop shops for an array of services including shopping, deliveries, payments and lending.\\n\\nGo-Jek said it is still working with regulators to smooth the way for its new operations. It said each of the overseas businesses will have local founders and develop their own brands “to ensure good traction in each new market.”\\n\\nGrab already operates in eight countries in Southeast Asia, a region of more than 600 million people.\\n\\n“Consumers are happiest when they have choice and at the moment, people in Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines don’t feel they’re getting enough when it comes to ride-hailing,” said Go-Jek’s founder Nadiem Makarim.</th>\n",

       "      <th>There is a different kind of vibe in the newly furbished GO-JEK office in Bengaluru. After all, one of the biggest startup businesses of Indonesia just set up its engineering base in the city.\\n\\nThe man of the hour, GO-JEK founder and CEO Nadiem Makarim, sits at the conference table along with the founders of Indian startups he has acquired.\\n\\nIn Q4 2015, the on-demand services behemoth had acquired web-applications and devops startups C42 and CodeIgnition. These were followed by the purchases of healthcare startup Pianta and, more recently, Pune-based Leftshift technologies.\\n\\nToday, the founders of these startups are core members of GO-JEK’s tech leadership. Having worked with these startups as technology contractors, Nadiem says that it was these acquisitions that led them to the decision of making India their engineering base.\\n\\nThis tech aggression seems like the need of the hour, with the company witnessing exponential growth that no one, including GO-JEK’s investors, saw coming. From the launch of their app in 2015, the firm quickly scaled to 26 million downloads, completing 100 million bookings (till Q2 of 2016) and spreading their wings across 15 verticals from food couriering to home services.\\n\\nAnd all wasn’t well.\\n\\nThis fast-paced scaling catapulted into complaints about the app framework. In an earlier interview, Nadiem was quoted saying that the company grew so fast that they lost control of how many people downloaded their app, grossly underestimating their own growth rate.\\n\\nBut don’t take them lightly. Having already scaled to a team of 109 engineers, Nadiem says that they’d allow only the best of the best to be a part of the regime. To quantify it, he says,\\n\\n“Only five percent of the total applicant base really makes it to the grind.”\\n\\nIn addition to their in-house strength, the company continues to work with 15 technology contractors, and Nadiem’s answer to any kind of acqui-hiring is straightforward. He says,\\n\\nThe philosophy is simple - we will continue to grow either through acquiring or organic hiring.\\n\\nGoing to his roots\\n\\nSo, how did a business that was started on the sidelines grow into a well fed multi-sectoral giant in Indonesia? The answer lies in Nadiem’s journey.\\n\\nAfter his stint in Brown University, Nadiem joined the consulting behemoth McKinsey &amp; Co. There, he kick-started an initiative under the name Young Leaders of Indonesia. The initiative was not just a step for him to learn about the world of entrepreneurship, but also got him into the prestigious Harvard Business School. This education paved the way for his journey into the startup world.\\n\\nAfter a stint of building Rocket Internet in Indonesia, Nadiem tried his hand at several ventures. Most failed, but, surprisingly, GO-JEK stuck.\\n\\nWhile in Indonesia, he did quite a bit of travelling through indigenous bike taxis called Ojeks. Not relying on them solely for transportation, he also used the taxis for services involving buying food or even delivering couriers.\\n\\nAnd that seems to have struck a chord, prompting Nadiem to look into opportunities in the space.\\n\\nStarting up, the idea was to channelise the market by introducing a call centre, requesting ojek drivers to pick up customers on-demand and transport them. At that time, he did not quite realise the potential of what he was building. The company managed quick organic growth.\\n\\nBig rivals come knocking\\n\\nThings, however, formalised in 2014 with the entrance of Uber and GrabTaxi; the latter a firm run by his good friend at Harvard and now arch-rival Anthony Tan. When GrabTaxi (now called Grab) was planning to enter the bike taxi market in Indonesia, they had a cumulative funding of $250 million, while GO-JEK had only $2 million in investments.\\n\\nThings quickly changed and investor interest started peaking. Some attention also came the way of GO-JEK, and Nadiem knew that this was a wave he wanted to ride.\\n\\nBeing a call centre service up till 2014, GO-JEK quickly moved forward with the launch of their app in 2015, aggressively taking the stance of a mobile-first company.\\n\\nToday, GO-JEK claims to be an Indonesian market leader across several of their verticals - Go-Car (launched in April this year); Go-Food (food delivery); Go-Mart (online shopping); Go- Send (their courier service); Go-Box (their courier service for large scale businesses); Go-Clean (home services); Go-Med (medicine prescription delivery) and many more. The company is aggressively pushing their wallet Go-Pay, currently in the user acquisition phase, with plans to open it to the market in a few months.\\n\\nNadiem says,\\n\\nThe closest business model we come to is China’s WeChat, but unlike WeChat, here we also own the complete supply chain of the products endorsed and provided on our platform.\\n\\nBuilding the Indonesian behemoth\\n\\nIn August this year, the GO-JEK group closed a massive funding round of $550 million, valuing the company at almost $1.3 billion. This is the largest ever valuation for an Indonesian technology startup.\\n\\nThe new round of funding was led by KKR &amp; Co. and Warburg Pincus LLC, with the likes of Sequoia Capital, DST Global and Singapore-based NSI Ventures already among GO-JEK’s existing investors.\\n\\nAnd why not? With a strong network of more than 240,000 drivers across 15 Indonesian cities, the GO-JEK app has seen more than 26 million downloads and 100 million bookings since its launch.\\n\\nTo provide an idea of the company’s growth, in December 2014, the company was a network of barely 600 drivers, with 16,000 customers and 70 corporate clients. By the end of 2015, the firm claimed to be pushing out 340,000 orders a day. That is nothing less than a massive leap from where they started.\\n\\nA simple formula for success\\n\\nToday, their food delivery business, Go-Food, has 40,000 restaurants listed on its platform, and their hyperlocal business, Go-mart, has 50 different types of stores available. Alone, in 18 months, the firm has processed 50 million orders, far bigger than any Indian counterpart, including Swiggy, which has just 5,000 restaurants on its platform (as of April 2016).\\n\\nExplaining the reason for the upswing, Nadiem comments,\\n\\nYou see, we weren’t ever teaching people to do something new. Rather, the best way to put it is that we were optimising the way these people did it.\\n\\nUsing ojeks was always a big part of Indonesian culture, and GO-JEK believes that they just added a layer of convenience to it. This is quite contrary to Indian markets, where players had to push customers into habituation.\\n\\nHowever, with such scale, Nadiem still believes that they will be maintaining their focus on Indonesia. He adds,\\n\\nThe Indonesian market is huge, with the per capita spend and mobile penetration being extremely high. Higher than most South-Asian markets. Looking at this opportunity, I am sure that, eventually, there will be more and more billion-dollar companies entering the market. At that point, we would like to hold on to our competitive edge, while being real market leaders in the segments we function in.\\n\\nAnd Nadiem lays it down simply that there have been just two basic things that have led to GO-JEK’s success – their team and the innate culture of taking risks.\\n\\nThe news of GO-JEK opening its engineering centre in India comes as proof of the strong technology talent pool that the country has to offer. After biggies like Twitter and Ebay announcing their exits, the global unicorns seem to be milking the technology base of the world’s second largest startup market.\\n\\nWe can, therefore, say with confidence that good times are down the road!</th>\n",

       "      <th>After Dunzo, Google now invests in Indonesian ride-hailing platform Go-Jek</th>\n",
       "      <th>Google on Monday said it has invested in Indonesian ride-sharing platform Go-Jek along with Singapore’s Temasek and China’s Meituan - Dianping. A report in TechCrunch said Google, Temasek, and Meituan - Dianping, were a part of the tranche of $1.2 billion that the ride-hailing platform was working on since last April.\\n\\nThe current valuation of Go-Jek now stands at $4 billion, and this is Google’s first direct investment in Indonesia. This announcement comes a month after its first direct investment in India, Dunzo, in December last year. This investment by Google also falls under the next billion initiative.\\n\\nIn its blog, Google said:\\n\\n“Indonesia already has a thriving internet economy, and a bustling startup scene, home to four of Southeast Asia’s eight “unicorns,” but we’d like to do more to help supercharge and grow with it. So, to help Indonesians build the next great startup, we’ve already trained nearly 60,000 Indonesians on mobile app development, toward our goal of reaching 100,000 developers by 2020. And to help more Indonesian small businesses tap into the power of the internet, our Gapura Digital initiative has trained more than 40,000 small business owners in 10 cities, with more cities to come.”\\n\\nThus, while Dara Khosrowshahi, might call India and Southeast Asia unprofitable, these regions seem to be biggest markets and have seen the largest growth. The TechCrunch article stated ride-hailing in Southeast Asia is set to become a $20.1 billion market by 2025, going up from $5.1 billion in 2017.\\n\\nIndonesia, the report states, will own close to 40 percent of the revenue. After India, Indonesia is the second country globally to get a ‘Google Station.’ The Google Blog also stated:\\n\\n“We have also designed products to work for Indonesians. YouTube Go helps Indonesians watch their favourite videos even with poor connectivity. And most recently, Indonesia was one of the first two countries in the world to get our new app, Google Go, which makes searching the internet faster and simpler for Indonesians on slow connections.”\\n\\nThe reason Google invested in Go-Jek is that the company is led by a strong management team, and has a proven track record of using technology to make life simple. The blog said:\\n\\n“By investing in local companies, building locally relevant products and training local talent, we hope to see more amazing local champions like Go-Jek emerge in Indonesia. As always, we’re driven and inspired by our users and partners and are always on the the lookout for more opportunities to support them.”\\n\\nCurrently active in Indonesia alone, Go-Jek’s bike taxis and hyperlocal services are giving tough competition to the likes of Grab and Uber.\\n\\nWebsite</th>\n",

       "      <th>BENGALURU: Indonesia’s bike taxi service Go-Jek , one of the most watched startups in Southeast Asia, is setting up a development centre in India by acquiring two local companies — Bengaluru-based software engineering company C42 Engineering and Delhi-based CodeIgnition.The deal is aimed at helping Go-Jek set up a research &amp; development (R&amp;D) center in Bengaluru, where it plans to recruit over 100 senior engineers in the next six months. Size or structure of the transactions was not disclosed.Go-Jek, which is backed by Sequoia Capital India and Yuri Milner’s DST Global, zeroed in on the Indian companies while searching for a solution to a software bug that hit its mobile application.“We lost control over our growth then our investor Sequoia extended a helping hand by introducing us to founders of C42 and CodeIgnition, they saved us from imploding,” said Nadiem Makarim, the Jakarta-based founder of Go-Jek. The company’s mobile application downloads have grown to 11million since it was launched in January 2015.Makarim said that Go-Jek has become the largest consumer-internet company in Indonesia on parameters like number of transactions, funding raised and valuation.He declined to disclose any numbers, and the company had not even formally announced its financing rounds from Sequoia and DST Global, so far.Having begun as a bike taxi business, Go-Jek has diversified into food delivery, one-hour courier delivery, grocery delivery and even has aggregated trucks on its platform.It has partnered with 2,00,000 motorcycle drivers and 5,000 trucks across Indonesia, claiming that daily transaction volumes have gone up over a hundredfold in the last six months.“We have more vehicles than Uber has in the US, and we are the largest online food delivery company outside the US and China,” said Makarim, a Harvard Business School MBA who has worked at consulting firm McKinsey and Germany’s internet accelerator Rocket Internet.“We are all online and offline businesses rolled up into one, which is unlike India and China where things are fairly specialised,” said Makarim, adding that Go-Jek is a mix of Ola, Zomato, Tinyowl, Grofers and few other startups rolled into one given the cross selling opportunities.Experts tracking the cross border M&amp;A space said that this is a first of its kind acquisition from a South East Asian internet company. “We have seen interest from the US companies to set up development centres here through acquisitions here, not Asian companies,” said Sanat Rao, M&amp;A adviser at software product think tank iSPIRT.C42 Engineering, which has worked with Indian e-tailers like Flipkart ad Urbanladder, was founded in 2010 as a boutique ruby and rails consultancy. Its founders include former software consulting firm Thoughtworks execs Sidu Ponnappa and Niranjan Paranjape, and restaurant review platform Burrp’s alumni Aakash Dharmadhikari.</th>\n",

       "      <th>Bisnis.com, DENPASAR -- Program GO-JEK Swadaya diklaim telah mendorong inklusi keuangan di Indonesia lantaran mampu mengajak hampir 50% lebih mitra driver untuk memanfaatkan sejumlah pengelolaan finansial.\\n\\nSaat ini ada sekitar sejuta lebih mitra driver GO-JEK di Indonesia. Hampir 500.000 lebih sudah mengikuti program GO-JEK SWADAYA.\\n\\nVice President of Drivers Community GO-JEK Indonesia Jaka Wiradisuria mengatakan, untuk wilayah Bali, pihaknya bekerja sama dengan industri perbankan seperti BTN untuk cicilan KPR, BNI Syariah untuk tabungan umrah, dan program proteksi dari Pasar Polis. Sebelum ada program GO-JEK SWADAYA, mitra driver kerap kesulitan mengajukan bantuan pembiayaan tersebut.\\n\\nDia mencontohkan saat ini mitra driver yang ingin memiliki rumah idaman dapat memanfaatkan skema cicilan Kredit Perumahan Rakyat (KPR) harian. Hanya dengan Rp48.000 per hari, para mitra driver dapat memiliki rumah idaman mereka. Para mitra driver dapat dengan mudah memanfaatkan program GO-JEK SWADAYA yang ada pada aplikasi driver mereka untuk mengajukan kredit pemilikan rumah (KPR).\\n\\n\"Ini membuktikan bahwa para mitra driver Bali dapat menikmati semua akses finansial yang sebelumnya sulit bagi mereka,\" katanya, Jumat (31/8/2018).\\n\\nMenurut Jaka, mitra driver juga mendapatkan akses proteksi finansial terjangkau, mulai dari asuransi kesehatan on-trip dan off-trip bagi mitra dan keluarga melalui kerja sama dengan Allianz. Selain itu, ada jaminan barang pribadi dan perlindungan kecelakaan melalui kerja sama dengan Pasar Polis, serta jaminan hari tua melalui kerja sama dengan BPJS Ketenagakerjaan.\\n\\n\"Hadirnya kami di 66 kota di Indonesia juga membuka jalan seluas-luasnya pada peningkatan inklusi finansial di kalangan mitra pengemudi,” katanya.</th>\n",

Karena mereka menjatuhkan harga pasaran,\" ketus dia saat berbincang dengan Liputan6.com di pangkalan ojek Senayan, Minggu (14/6/2015).\\n\\n\\n\\nDijelaskannya, Go-Jek menggunakan sistem tarif per kilometer (km).

Size or structure of the transactions was not disclosed.Go-Jek, which is backed by Sequoia Capital India and Yuri Milner’s DST Global, zeroed in on the Indian companies while searching for a solution to a software bug that hit its mobile application.“We lost control over our growth then our investor Sequoia extended a helping hand by introducing us to founders of C42 and CodeIgnition, they saved us from imploding,” said Nadiem Makarim, the Jakarta-based founder of Go-Jek. The company’s mobile application downloads have grown to 11million since it was launched in January 2015.Makarim said that Go-Jek has become the largest consumer-internet company in Indonesia on parameters like number of transactions, funding raised and valuation.He declined to disclose any numbers, and the company had not even formally announced its financing rounds from Sequoia and DST Global, so far. Having begun as a biketaxi business, Go-Jek has diversified into food delivery, one-hour courier delivery, grocery delivery and even has aggregated trucks on its platform. It has partnered with 2,00,000 motorcycle drivers and 5,000 trucks across Indonesia, claiming that daily transaction volumes have gone up over a hundredfold in the last six months.“We have more vehicles than Uber has in the US, and we are the largest online food delivery company outside the US and China,” said Makarim, a Harvard Business School MBA who has worked at consulting firm McKinsey and Germany’s internet accelerator Rocket Internet.“We are all online and offline businesses rolled up into one, which is unlike India and China where things are fairly specialised,” said Makarim, adding that Go-Jek is a mix of Ola, Zomato, Tinyowl, Grofers and few other startups rolled into one given the cross selling opportunities.Experts tracking the cross border M&amp;A space said that this is a first of its kind acquisition from a South East Asian internet company. “We have seen interest from the US companies to set up development centres here through acquisitions here, not Asian companies,” said Sanat Rao, M&amp;A adviser at software product think tank iSPIRT.C42 Engineering, which has worked with Indian etailers like Flipkart ad Urbanladder, was founded in 2010 as a boutique ruby and rails consultancy.

Kami dari Management Go-Jek telah mendapatkan info atas masukan dari berbagai sumber bahwa akan diadakan aksi Demo/Mogok Massal/ Sweeping yang diprakasai oleh beberapa provokator,\" isi pesan tersebut.\\n\\nSebagai informasi, ribuan driver Go-Jek yang tergabung di wilayah Jakarta, hari ini mogok narik, alias tidak ingin mengangkut penumpang. Aksi mogok massal itu disebabkan karena bentuk protes terhadap perusahaan yang dianggap tidak loyal lagi kepada driver.\\n\\nHal tersebut lantaran adanya perubahan tarif secara sepihak yang dilakukan pihak PT Go-Jek Indonesia. Adapun perubahan sepihak tersebut seperti perubahan sebelumnya jarak terjauh mencapai Rp100 ribu tapi saat ini menjadi Rp75 ribu.\\n\\nKemudian penurunan harga per km, sebelumnya Rp4.000 per km tapi sekarang diubah jadi Rp3.000 per km. Kemudian perubahan ketika driver mendapat lima poin mendapat bonus Rp50 ri bu saat ini diubah menjadi delapan poin baru mendapat bonus.\\n\\nHingga berita ini diturunkan, pihak Management Go-Jek masih belum mau berkomentar.\\n\\nNamun menyikapi aksi mogok massal para driver, Head of Marketing Go-Box Nanda Eka Putra menyatakan akan ada pernyataan resmi yang akan dipublikasikan. “Nanti akan ada official statement. Biasanya via Facebook atau Instragram,” ujarnya.\\n\\n(mrt)</th>\n",

The reason was because the two were not listed as a public transportation mode in the Traffic (LLAJ) Law No. 22 Year 2009.

Photo: Reddit/Roflpaladin\\n\\nSince its smartphone application debuted early this year, motorcycle taxi service Go-Jek has quickly become an integral part of Jakarta’s transportation network. This has led to numerous clashes with traditional ojek drivers that have been covered extensively in the media (there’s a particularly illuminating article on the subject from Tech in Asia).\\n\\nThe government and police have promised to protect Go-Jek drivers from other ojek drivers who attack or intimidate them for working in their territory, but there had been little evidence of that protection reported in the media so far.\\n\\nBut now some Go-Jek drivers are claiming that the police are backing them up in a big way – by sending undercover officers to crack down on places where traditional ojeks have organized against the new guard.\\n\\n“Now we are receiving back up from members of Brimob (Mobile Brigade Police). So at vulnerable points, there are members of Brimob disguised in civilian clothes,” Faridz Budhi a 33 year old Go-Jek driver, told Kompas on Sunday.\\n\\nFaridz said he felt a lot safer now when entering areas that were previously prone to intimidation against Go-Jeks, though he said he had never experienced any harassment directly since he started the Go-Jek gig a month ago.\\n\\nAnother Go-Jek driver, Helmi Can, echoed Faridz sentiments, saying, “We have been told about this. We have backup from Brimob, so there is no need to worry.”\\n\\nWhile it would certainly be good if the police were making such an effort to protect Go-Jek drivers from intimidation and abuse, the police themselves have not confirmed an operation like the Go-Jek drivers described.\\n\\nWhen asked by Kompas, Jakarta Police Chief Tito Karnavian claimed not to know anything about it.\\n\\n“I have not heard of (Brimob members providing backup for Go-Jeks),” Tito said yesterday.\\n\\nBut the police chief said that his officers would of course take action against any criminal actions by ojeks, regardless of the victims.\\n\\nSo are the Go-Jek drivers misinformed? Or are the police actually just not telling the media about an ongoing undercover operation? We’ll just have to wait and see how much worse the battle of old and new will get.</th>\n",

They’ll look at you wide-eyed in disbelief, and then shrug their shoulders and say “Who cares, grandpa?” before flying away on their Go-Jet.\\n\\nAt any rate, it’s a good time to be an ojek rider in Jakarta, as the two giants of the emergent online ojek industry, local outfit Go-Jek and Malaysia-based GrabBike, battle for the hearts of customers in Indonesia.\\n\\nFor quite a while, both companies have been offering absurdly low promo rates for customers to get them hooked on their services, with Go-Jek introducing a Rp 10k flat rate promo during Ramadan and GrabBike offering an even more ridiculously rate of Rp 5k, with the companies picking up the rest of the bill.\\n\\nAnalysts were wondering what would happen when both companies returned to their normal per-kilometer pricing structures and how many customers they would hang on to. But it looks like we won’t find out for a while, as both Go-Jek and GrabBike are extending their price promos for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nStarting today, Go-Jek is introducing a slightly higher tariff of Rp 15k to take passengers anywhere in the capital. Courier and delivery services remain Rp 10k. No end date has been announced for this promo.\\n\\nHai GO-JEKERS!

For now, the customers are the winners.\\n\\nWe do feel somewhat sorry for the old-school ojeks, who have no way of competing against Go-Jek or GrabBike on price point. No wonder they’re so pissed at the new upstarts. But even the most stubborn ojek may soon be forced to join one of the big two if they want to keep making a living.</th>\n",

Does Go-Jek stand a chance in the Philippine market?\\n\\nApplications in limbo?\\n\\nAs early as May, Go-Jek expressed interest to enter the Philippines and met with Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) officials.\\n\\nLTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada expressed concerns then, saying that the entry of a foreign firm \"would displace\" the new local transport network companies (TNCs). Go-Jek plans to introduce ride-hailing services for sedans, SUVs, AUVs, and taxis around Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao.\\n\\nThe LTFRB issued Memorandum Circular (MC) 2018-016 on August 9, freezing accreditation applications for new TNCs. It said it issued the order so it can focus on the pending applications and to monitor existing players.\\n\\nAs of the MC's publication, there were 5 firms listed vying for accreditation. Go-Jek was not on the list.\\n\\n\"All applicants with applications for TNC accreditation pending before the pre-accreditation committee are hereby directed to submit their complete and compliant requirements within 10 days of receipt or on August 5, whichever is later, otherwise their applications shall be denied by the committee,\" the order said.\\n\\nThe order was effective August 29.\\n\\nIn previous messages to the media, the LTFRB said that Go-Jek's application was \"on hold,\" as it passed its accreditation papers on August 13 – days after the memorandum circular was issued.\\n\\nRappler clarified this with LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III, noting that Go-Jek's submission date was before the MC's effectivity date.\\n\\nDelgra said that Go-Jek \"did not apply\" but Velox Technology Philippines did, along with two other firms. Velox is the local subsidiary of Go-Jek.\\n\\n\"The memorandum circular sets a deadline as to when they can file their accreditation requirements. They were able to make the cut. It is Velox applying,\" Delgra told Rappler in a phone interview.\\n\\nThe regulatory board chief said the fate of the applications rests on the pre-accreditation committee. There are 4 firms awaiting evaluation of the committee while one has a pending resolution on its application.\\n\\n\"The deliberations are ongoing. They are set to deliberate the first 4. The remaining 3 will be deliberated hopefully starting next year,\" Delgra said.\\n\\nMore competition\\n\\nSome local TNCs have expressed some reservation over the possible entry of another multibillion-dollar company in the Philippine ride-hailing market.\\n\\nBut Go-Jek believes that competition drives other firms to give better services to its customers.\\n\\n\"Go-Jek does not believe in a winner-takes-all approach to ride-hailing. That enough space exists for many different approaches and ideas from companies both large and small,\" Go-Jek said in a statement sent to Rappler.\\n\\n\"Smaller companies have more of a chance to succeed, learn, and grow in a competitive market, than a market with a single player controlling most of the market,\" it added.\\n\\nGo-Jek was awaiting for the LTFRB's green light \"before anything else,\" such as hiring employees for its local operations.\\n\\n\"Go-Jek is ready and waiting to provide the Philippines with a new mobility solution as soon as we are given the go-ahead,\" it said.\\n\\nEconomist JC Punongbayan said that Go-Jek's entry would be healthy for the market, given that new players have yet to make a difference in the market.\\n\\n\"We should actually embrace Go-Jek's entry as a way for our local competitors to innovate. It has been a major player in Indonesia for quite some time. It could bring its expertise in technology and inform policies,\" Punongbayan said.\\n\\nHe added that another big player would hopefully help bring down the average prices of ride-hailing services, as the firms would compete for riders.\\n\\nOn the part of the consumers, Laban Konsyumer Incorporated president Vic Dimagiba said that the best way is still to open up the market.\\n\\n\"If you really want the consumer to have better choices, then open up the market with those as good as Grab. But of course, we don't know yet what will happen to the smaller companies,\" Dimagiba, a former trade undersecretary, told Rappler.\\n\\nBring in what works\\n\\nWas the LTFRB right in freezing the accreditation application of TNCs? The antitrust body Philippine Competition Commission would agree on some points.\\n\\nPCC Commissioner Stella Quimbo acknowledged Grab's dominance over the 7 other local firms. Asked if another big player poses a threat to the smaller players, Quimbo said, \"There's no one to threaten.\"\\n\\n\"It's all speculative. At this point, who's going to be threatened? The 6 that can compete with Grab are not yet competing,\" she said.\\n\\nBut Quimbo pointed that the test of viability in the market is important, and that might mean looking for other options outside the country.\\n\\n\"We want entry plus viability. [But] what's the test for viability? In the history of the Philippines, we've only had two viable ones. If you want to look for an alternative that is also viable, we have no choice but to look outside of the country,\" Quimbo said.\\n\\nIn August, the PCC approved Grab's acquisition of Uber, but has bound the former to fair pricing conditions and service quality commitments.\\n\\nThe antitrust body may release Grab from the commitments if there is already \"sufficient competition in the market.\" Quimbo said, however, that the PCC can still hold Grab accountable \"if they abuse their dominance\" after the commitment period.\\n\\nThe LTFRB said that Go-Jek's application may be reviewed in 2019. This would mean more time for the consumers to wait for another option on the same scale as Grab.\\n\\nAs the new TNCs continue to adjust to the challenges of the ride-hailing market, until when will Filipinos wait for a viable option? – Rappler.com</th>\n",

(Reuters/Beawiharta).\\n\\nGrab to Invest $250 Million in Indonesian Startups in Race Against Go-jek\\n\\nGrab will invest $250 million in Indonesian startups over the next three years through its newly launched innovation arm, as the ride-hailing firm aggressively pushes to cement its position in Southeast Asia’s largest economy.\\n\\nThe Singapore-based firm has raised $2 billion in funding in recent months and also launched the Grab Ventures arm to develop technology start-ups in sectors beyond ride-hailing as it locks horns with Indonesia’s Go-Jek for regional dominance.\\n\\n“We are looking at startups in both series A and B, which we could integrate into our ecosystem,” Ridzki Kramadibrata, managing director for Indonesia, told Reuters.\\n\\nThe company, which counts Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing and Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp among its backers, has already started looking at startups and will start funding rounds later this year, he added.\\n\\nGrab is interested in healthcare and food-and-grocery delivery startups as well as those that facilitate digital payments and automated processes, he added.\\n\\nGrab’s rival Go-Jek has already evolved from a ride-hailing service to a one-stop app allowing Indonesian clients to make online payments and order everything from food, groceries to massages. It is now looking to expand in Southeast Asia, to Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, and Singapore.\\n\\nKramadibrata said Grab is currently the top ride-hailing player in Indonesia and that he was confident the firm would be able to maintain the lead. The firm is valued at around $11 billion, according to sources.\\n\\n“We hold 65 percent of (Indonesia’s) ride-hailing market, as based on total rides and transactions,” said Kramadibrata. “And it won’t stop there, our market share is increasing.”\\n\\nHe reckons Grab holds majority market share in 137 cities in Indonesia, compared with Go-Jek’s roughly 50.\\n\\nKramadibrata said he based his estimates on internal and third-party data that he declined to reveal.\\n\\nGo-Jek did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\\n\\nIts CEO, Nadiem Makarim, told Reuters this month that the company’s app was a market leader in Indonesia, processing more than 100 million transactions for 20-25 million monthly users.\\n\\nHe did not specify how many of those transactions were only for ride-hailing.\\n\\nRide-hailing services in Southeast Asia are expected to surge to $20.1 billion in gross merchandise value by 2025 from $5.1 billion in 2017, according to a Google-Temasek report.\\n\\nBy Cindy Silviana.</th>\n",

       "      <th>There is a different kind of vibe in the newly furbished GO-JEK office in Bengaluru. After all, one of the biggest startup businesses of Indonesia just set up its engineering base in the city.\\n\\nThe man of the hour, GO-JEK founder and CEO Nadiem Makarim, sits at the conference table along with the founders of Indian startups he has acquired.\\n\\nIn Q4 2015, the on-demand services behemoth had acquired web-applications and devops startups C42 and CodeIgnition. These were followed by the purchases of healthcare startup Pianta and, more recently, Pune-based Leftshift technologies.\\n\\nToday, the founders of these startups are core members of GO-JEK’s tech leadership. Having worked with these startups as technology contractors, Nadiem says that it was these acquisitions that led them to the decision of making India their engineering base.\\n\\nThis tech aggression seems like the need of the hour, with the company witnessing exponential growth that no one, including GO-JEK’s investors, saw coming. From the launch of their app in 2015, the firm quickly scaled to 26 million downloads, completing 100 million bookings (till Q2 of 2016) and spreading their wings across 15 verticals from food couriering to home services.\\n\\nAnd all wasn’t well.\\n\\nThis fast-paced scaling catapulted into complaints about the app framework. In an earlier interview, Nadiem was quoted saying that the company grew so fast that they lost control of how many people downloaded their app, grossly underestimating their own growth rate.\\n\\nBut don’t take them lightly. Having already scaled to a team of 109 engineers, Nadiem says that they’d allow only the best of the best to be a part of the regime. To quantify it, he says,\\n\\n“Only five percent of the total applicant base really makes it to the grind.”\\n\\nIn addition to their in-house strength, the company continues to work with 15 technology contractors, and Nadiem’s answer to any kind of acqui-hiring is straightforward. He says,\\n\\nThe philosophy is simple - we will continue to grow either through acquiring or organic hiring.\\n\\nGoing to his roots\\n\\nSo, how did a business that was started on the sidelines grow into a well fed multi-sectoral giant in Indonesia? The answer lies in Nadiem’s journey.\\n\\nAfter his stint in Brown University, Nadiem joined the consulting behemoth McKinsey &amp; Co. There, he kick-started an initiative under the name Young Leaders of Indonesia. The initiative was not just a step for him to learn about the world of entrepreneurship, but also got him into the prestigious Harvard Business School. This education paved the way for his journey into the startup world.\\n\\nAfter a stint of building Rocket Internet in Indonesia, Nadiem tried his hand at several ventures. Most failed, but, surprisingly, GO-JEK stuck.\\n\\nWhile in Indonesia, he did quite a bit of travelling through indigenous bike taxis called Ojeks. Not relying on them solely for transportation, he also used the taxis for services involving buying food or even delivering couriers.\\n\\nAnd that seems to have struck a chord, prompting Nadiem to look into opportunities in the space.\\n\\nStarting up, the idea was to channelise the market by introducing a call centre, requesting ojek drivers to pick up customers on-demand and transport them. At that time, he did not quite realise the potential of what he was building. The company managed quick organic growth.\\n\\nBig rivals come knocking\\n\\nThings, however, formalised in 2014 with the entrance of Uber and GrabTaxi; the latter a firm run by his good friend at Harvard and now arch-rival Anthony Tan. When GrabTaxi (now called Grab) was planning to enter the bike taxi market in Indonesia, they had a cumulative funding of $250 million, while GO-JEK had only $2 million in investments.\\n\\nThings quickly changed and investor interest started peaking. Some attention also came the way of GO-JEK, and Nadiem knew that this was a wave he wanted to ride.\\n\\nBeing a call centre service up till 2014, GO-JEK quickly moved forward with the launch of their app in 2015, aggressively taking the stance of a mobile-first company.\\n\\nToday, GO-JEK claims to be an Indonesian market leader across several of their verticals - Go-Car (launched in April this year); Go-Food (food delivery); Go-Mart (online shopping); Go- Send (their courier service); Go-Box (their courier service for large scale businesses); Go-Clean (home services); Go-Med (medicine prescription delivery) and many more. The company is aggressively pushing their wallet Go-Pay, currently in the user acquisition phase, with plans to open it to the market in a few months.\\n\\nNadiem says,\\n\\nThe closest business model we come to is China’s WeChat, but unlike WeChat, here we also own the complete supply chain of the products endorsed and provided on our platform.\\n\\nBuilding the Indonesian behemoth\\n\\nIn August this year, the GO-JEK group closed a massive funding round of $550 million, valuing the company at almost $1.3 billion. This is the largest ever valuation for an Indonesian technology startup.\\n\\nThe new round of funding was led by KKR &amp; Co. and Warburg Pincus LLC, with the likes of Sequoia Capital, DST Global and Singapore-based NSI Ventures already among GO-JEK’s existing investors.\\n\\nAnd why not? With a strong network of more than 240,000 drivers across 15 Indonesian cities, the GO-JEK app has seen more than 26 million downloads and 100 million bookings since its launch.\\n\\nTo provide an idea of the company’s growth, in December 2014, the company was a network of barely 600 drivers, with 16,000 customers and 70 corporate clients. By the end of 2015, the firm claimed to be pushing out 340,000 orders a day. That is nothing less than a massive leap from where they started.\\n\\nA simple formula for success\\n\\nToday, their food delivery business, Go-Food, has 40,000 restaurants listed on its platform, and their hyperlocal business, Go-mart, has 50 different types of stores available. Alone, in 18 months, the firm has processed 50 million orders, far bigger than any Indian counterpart, including Swiggy, which has just 5,000 restaurants on its platform (as of April 2016).\\n\\nExplaining the reason for the upswing, Nadiem comments,\\n\\nYou see, we weren’t ever teaching people to do something new. Rather, the best way to put it is that we were optimising the way these people did it.\\n\\nUsing ojeks was always a big part of Indonesian culture, and GO-JEK believes that they just added a layer of convenience to it. This is quite contrary to Indian markets, where players had to push customers into habituation.\\n\\nHowever, with such scale, Nadiem still believes that they will be maintaining their focus on Indonesia. He adds,\\n\\nThe Indonesian market is huge, with the per capita spend and mobile penetration being extremely high. Higher than most South-Asian markets. Looking at this opportunity, I am sure that, eventually, there will be more and more billion-dollar companies entering the market. At that point, we would like to hold on to our competitive edge, while being real market leaders in the segments we function in.\\n\\nAnd Nadiem lays it down simply that there have been just two basic things that have led to GO-JEK’s success – their team and the innate culture of taking risks.\\n\\nThe news of GO-JEK opening its engineering centre in India comes as proof of the strong technology talent pool that the country has to offer. After biggies like Twitter and Ebay announcing their exits, the global unicorns seem to be milking the technology base of the world’s second largest startup market.\\n\\nWe can, therefore, say with confidence that good times are down the road!</th>\n",

       "      <th>Google on Monday said it has invested in Indonesian ride-sharing platform Go-Jek along with Singapore’s Temasek and China’s Meituan - Dianping. A report in TechCrunch said Google, Temasek, and Meituan - Dianping, were a part of the tranche of $1.2 billion that the ride-hailing platform was working on since last April.\\n\\nThe current valuation of Go-Jek now stands at $4 billion, and this is Google’s first direct investment in Indonesia. This announcement comes a month after its first direct investment in India, Dunzo, in December last year. This investment by Google also falls under the next billion initiative.\\n\\nIn its blog, Google said:\\n\\n“Indonesia already has a thriving internet economy, and a bustling startup scene, home to four of Southeast Asia’s eight “unicorns,” but we’d like to do more to help supercharge and grow with it. So, to help Indonesians build the next great startup, we’ve already trained nearly 60,000 Indonesians on mobile app development, toward our goal of reaching 100,000 developers by 2020. And to help more Indonesian small businesses tap into the power of the internet, our Gapura Digital initiative has trained more than 40,000 small business owners in 10 cities, with more cities to come.”\\n\\nThus, while Dara Khosrowshahi, might call India and Southeast Asia unprofitable, these regions seem to be biggest markets and have seen the largest growth. The TechCrunch article stated ride-hailing in Southeast Asia is set to become a $20.1 billion market by 2025, going up from $5.1 billion in 2017.\\n\\nIndonesia, the report states, will own close to 40 percent of the revenue. After India, Indonesia is the second country globally to get a ‘Google Station.’ The Google Blog also stated:\\n\\n“We have also designed products to work for Indonesians. YouTube Go helps Indonesians watch their favourite videos even with poor connectivity. And most recently, Indonesia was one of the first two countries in the world to get our new app, Google Go, which makes searching the internet faster and simpler for Indonesians on slow connections.”\\n\\nThe reason Google invested in Go-Jek is that the company is led by a strong management team, and has a proven track record of using technology to make life simple. The blog said:\\n\\n“By investing in local companies, building locally relevant products and training local talent, we hope to see more amazing local champions like Go-Jek emerge in Indonesia. As always, we’re driven and inspired by our users and partners and are always on the the lookout for more opportunities to support them.”\\n\\nCurrently active in Indonesia alone, Go-Jek’s bike taxis and hyperlocal services are giving tough competition to the likes of Grab and Uber.\\n\\nWebsite</th>\n",
